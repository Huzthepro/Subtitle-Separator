* I build this program on demand of my translator friend who has to translate and separate subtitles to .srt files manually by copy paste the lines so each voice actor can have their own separated lines to perform.
* With Subtitle Separator it is possible to **tag lines** with colors for different voice actors and have them in **separeted .srt files** with just one click.
* You can also translate lines very easily or change timing while tagging lines with colors.
