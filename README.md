  Use Case
</h1>

<img alt="HowToUse" src="/wrongway.gif" align="right" width=30%>

* I build this program on demand of my translator friend who has to translate and separate subtitles to .srt files manually by copy paste the lines so each voice actor can have their own separated lines to perform.
* With Subtitle Separator it is possible to **tag lines** with colors for different voice actors and have them in **separeted .srt files** with just one click.
* You can also translate lines very easily or change timing while tagging lines with colors.

* Both .srt and .txt files can be edited.
* 8 different colors to tag the lines.
* Subtitle time can be changed, this will send that line to its correct row.
* Changing/Translating subtitle content, tagging color, changing time will put you next row automatically.
* Add row: Dublicate the previous row | Delte row: Deleting selected row and select the next one.
* You can save your current progress with save button.
